'''
Largest palindrome product

Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

def is_Palindrome(p):
    '''
    Input: integer.
    Method: converts input to string, reverses and compares.
    Output: returns Boolean.
    '''
    # non-optimized solution
    p, d = str(p), ''
    for i in range(len(p)-1, -1, -1):
        d += p[i]
    
    return p == d
        


def multiply_ndigitnumbers(n):
    '''
    Input: integer number of digit number to multiply.
    Method: 2 nested for loops O(n^2); tests if result is palindrome on each iteration and stores winner vs incumbent.
        Note: should be optimized with dynamic programming if larger results are desired but this is fast enough (< 1s for n=3: up to one minute of computation allowed) for now.
    Output: returns integer result which is the maximum palindrome.
